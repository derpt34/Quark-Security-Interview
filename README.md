# Times around the World

This program represents the local times of some of the largest cities around the world. Included is the .c source file, associated header files, and a Makefile for compiling the program.

## Installation

To use this program, you can either download the files within this repository to your local machine or clone the entire repository using the following command "git clone https://github.com/derpt34/Quark-Security-Interview.git".

## Use

Once you have the necessary files on your local machine, you can use the Makefile given and simply type "make" into the command line. This will assemble the program with the executable file "world-times.x", which can be run by entering s"./world-times.x" into the command line.

## Cleaning Up

Once you are done running the program, you can remove any non-essential files by running "make clean" in the command line.
